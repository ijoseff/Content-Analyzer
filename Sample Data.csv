20279994095,Wed 18-Nov-2020 09:15:00,RCEP trade pact shows multilateralism has to be revitalized,"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and leaders of other countries attend the signing ceremony of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement after the fourth RCEP Summit, which is held via video link, on Nov 15, 2020. [Photo/Xinhua] China's goal is to see that multilateralism triumphs over unilateralism. To confirm this, when the African Continental Free Trade Agreement came into operation on May 30, China was the first nation outside the continent of Africa to endorse the pact. This is a testament to show that China embraces multilateralism concept. This is because China believes that people, and by extension, nations have often been at war with one another for various reasons. But it is cooperation that has kept the global economy running. Following the Second World War, the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions have been the pillars of cooperation and multilateralism globally. While China agrees with the UN and Bretton Woods by embracing multilateralism, the United States under the leadership of anti-multilateralism President Donald Trump, whose thinking and ways portray the character of negating integration and preferring isolationism with the ""America First"" mantra, prefer the path of unilateralism. So, as Trump's unilateralism and isolationism administration draw to a close, it was timely for China to reach out, so to speak, and convince the South East Asian nations on the ASEAN platform to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. After eight years of talks reflecting their determination to strengthen economic unity and promote free trade, on Sunday China scored a ""victory"" when the long-awaited free trade pact was signed between 15 Asia-Pacific nations, regardless of political differences. It also makes China the champion of globalization and multilateral cooperation promoter. In the spirit of cooperation, China's priority is to put on trade ties with Asian nations. This is because during China's trade war with the US, trade with Asian and European nations now accounts for 70 percent of China's overall trade. On top of that, China is now ASEAN's biggest trading partner in the first quarter of 2020, giving China bargaining power when dealing with the US. All these wins are as a result of the fact that the US' trade wars and its economic threats pushed Beijing to diversify its trade options and lessen dependence on the US market. So, now that the new trade pact is inaugurated after a retreat by the US from sweeping trade agreements that reshape worldwide relationships, China and other Asian nations under the RCEP will tend to use the new trade pact to inject the ""economic vitality"" that Asian nations require to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced slump. The RCEP will act as a vital trade instrument that will continue to power worldwide growth and recovery, as well as pull the economic center of gravity toward the continent of Asia. No wonder the trade pact is currently referred to as the biggest free-trade pact globally, sealing a pact that excludes the US and extends China's message of building a community of shared future for mankind. The RCEP pact encompasses close to one-third of the world's population and covers a market of 2.2 billion people, or nearly 30 percent of the world's population, with a combined GDP of  26.2 trillion, or about 30 percent of global GDP. It is projected to add  186 billion to the world economy via improved regional trade. It is an unprecedented regional trading pact that includes a diverse mix of developed, developing and least-developed economies in the region. The pact aims to liberalize trade and investment across the Asia-Pacific region by lowering tariffs that will likely be eliminated on 86 percent of industrial goods exported from Japan to China and laying out new rules on government procurement, competition and policy for e-commerce. RCEP has created the first free trade that would bring together the three Asian giant economies that include South Korea, China and Japan. For the fact that Korea and Japan are natural allies of the US makes it quite interesting that these three nations would come together at a time Trump is moving in all directions for the exclusion and isolation of China using similar allies (South Korea and Japan) in the East Asian region. There are three things that struck my mind when I saw this move. First, since the US is presently focused on domestic concerns, including the necessity to combat the pandemic and rebuild its economy and infrastructure, the inclusion of Japan and South Korea reveals that the rest of the world will not wait around for the US. The European Union also has pursued trade negotiations at an aggressive pace. As other nations have signed novel agreements, with this move, US exporters may slowly lose ground. Second, it sends a signal that RCEP nations have chosen the path of multilateralism over unilateralism and to open their market instead of resorting to protectionist measures during this hard time. Third, it also sends another strong message that affirms ASEAN's leading role in supporting the multilateralism trading system, creating a novel trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalizing supply chains disrupted by coronavirus pandemic and providing a novel impetus that will help the post-COVID-19 recovery globally. The US' unilateral trade policy under the Trump administration, combined with COVID-19, has brought Asia-Pacific economies closer. The RCEP has echoed the necessity for Asia-Pacific economies to be in one accord after the Trump administration's trade war and unilateral trade policies. Guaranteeing stability in regional supply chains also has turned out to be much more imperative as the coronavirus pandemic has brought ruin to worldwide supply chains. Therefore, with the way it stands now, the RCEP pact is anticipated to assist South Korea, China and Japan to finally reach a trilateral trade agreement after years of struggling to bridge their differences. Although it is not clear how the US will respond to the novel trade agreement, however, now that Joe Biden is set to be sworn into office on January 20, the region is watching to see how the US foreign policy plays out on trade issues, since the United States' trade with China has turned out to be fraught issues. Although it might not be anytime soon Biden will want to focus more on the handling of the COVID-19, however, I believe that after the COVID-19 pandemic situation has subsided, Biden will push hard to rejoin the Trans-Pacific trade agreement and roll back most of the sanctions imposed on China by the Trump regime given the fact that the United States-Mexico-Canada Pact the revised version of the North American Free Trade Pact under the Trump administration, covers slightly less economic activity. Also, since the Trans-Pacific trade agreement has been promoted by former US president Barack Obama under which Biden served as vice-president, and as a new economic integration in Asia involving China, it can motivate and add pressure to Biden into thinking that the US needs to return to the Trans-Pacific trade agreement. In conclusion, the RCEP free trade treaty creates a momentum of free trade and puts out the message that the global economy is returning to globalization, away from the protectionism and isolationism concept pushed by the Trump administration.

20279970990,Wed 18-Nov-2020 08:48:00,Landmark RCEP trade pact to boost regional economic integration,"The signing ceremony of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement is held via video conference in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, Nov. 15, 2020. The RCEP agreement was signed among its 15 participating countries on Sunday, launching the world's biggest free trade bloc. (VNA via Xinhua) BEIJING, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- The signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's biggest trade pact, marks a new stride toward regional economic integration among Asia-Pacific countries. After 31 rounds of negotiations over eight years, the trade agreement between 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia and New Zealand was signed on Sunday. Hailed as ""a victory of multilateralism and free trade,"" the pact will vigorously boost confidence in regional trade and investment, reinforce the industrial and supply chains, hasten the economic recovery and promote the long-term prosperity of the region. The RCEP integrates existing free-trade partnerships among participating countries, while establishing new ones between China and Japan, and between Japan and the ROK, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said in a series of articles explaining the trade agreement on its website. The pact optimizes economic and trade rules among signatories, streamlining procedures to facilitate cross-border logistics and introducing negative lists to promote investment liberalization, the MOC said. More economic and technological assistance will be provided for the developing and least-developed economies in the region after the RCEP comes into force, as part of efforts to promote regional coordinated development, according to the ministry. Specifically, RCEP signatories will promote opening-up in trade in goods and services, investment and personnel exchange. After the pact takes effect, more than 90 percent of the import tariffs between participating countries will be phased out, which will reduce production costs and commodity prices, bringing benefits to both enterprises and consumers, said the MOC. The 15 signatories have all pledged wider opening-up in the services-trade sector, focusing on areas including health care, real estate, finance and transportation. Meanwhile, business people will be able to obtain visas more conveniently from RCEP countries, further facilitating trade and investment, said the MOC. Cao Jing, deputy secretary-general of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat, which consists of China, Japan and the ROK, said the signing of the RCEP will lead to robust growth of trade and investment in participating countries as it represents higher-level opening-up, a larger market and better policies. Covering a market of 2.27 billion people and a combined GDP of 26.2 trillion U.S. dollars, the RCEP signatories, which account for about one third of the world's economy, will become a large integrated market, thus injecting impetus into regional and global economic growth, the MOC said. The RCEP will also reduce the current ""obstructions"" in the global industrial chains and supply chains, and accelerate post-pandemic economic recovery, according to Cao. Signed at a time when a coronavirus-triggered recession looms large globally, the RCEP shines rays of hope through the dark clouds of global trade uncertainty, proving to the world that openness and cooperation are a sure path toward common prosperity. The signing of the RCEP is crucial and timely, said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, adding that the RCEP agreement represents a victory for multilateralism over unilateralism and free trade over protectionism. It accommodates the broadest possible interests, conditions and priorities and sends a clear message of East Asian countries working together for shared prosperity, said Ruan. ",ARTICLE,http://en.people.cn/n3/2020/1118/c90000-9781303.html,3470629713,People's Daily - Business,CN,BUSINESS,NEWS,en_US,http://en.people.cn/business/index.html,people.cn editor,http://en.people.cn/people.cn editor

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh, File) China and 14 other countries have agreed to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, is to be signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “After eight years of negotiating with blood, sweat and tears, we have finally come to the moment where we will seal the RCEP Agreement,"" Malaysia's trade minister, Mohamed Azmin Ali, said in a statement. The deal sends a signal that RCEP countries have chosen “to open our markets instead of resorting to protectionist measures during this difficult time,"" he said. The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office. It includes the 10 nations belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc. © Provided by Associated Press FILE - In this May 3, 2020, file photo, containers are loaded on a ship at the Saigon port in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. China and 14 other countries have agreed to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, is to be signed virtually on Sunday, Nov. 15, on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations. (AP Photo/Hau Dinh, File) It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements. The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America First"" policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity.Ahead of Sunday's RCEP “special summit"" meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government's support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.” The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalization and multilateral cooperation"" and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report. Now that Trump’s opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve. Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft. Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is “not going to squander that by going back into TPP,"" Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar. But given concerns over China's growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said. The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth. RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity.The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world's population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members. India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China.Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports.The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labor and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies. But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society. “RCEP, therefore, is a much-needed platform for the Indo-Pacific’s post-COVID recovery,"" he wrote. ASEAN members include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. ___Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed.",ARTICLE,https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/world/asean-china-other-partners-set-worlds-biggest-trade-pact/ar-BB1b12mw,1782394472,MSN News - World,SG,NEWS,NEWS,en_US,https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/world,"By ELAINE KURTENBACH, AP Business Writer","http://www.msn.com/By ELAINE KURTENBACH, AP Business Writer"
20280013378,Wed 18-Nov-2020 10:03:00,Trade pact for region hailed,"A cargo ship docks at Qinzhou Port in China-ASEAN Free Trade Area in Qinzhou, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, on July 11, 2020. [Photo/Xinhua] Reduced tariffs under RCEP will help revive battered economies, experts say The signing of the world's largest free-trade agreement will support the efforts of Asia-Pacific nations to rebuild their pandemic-hit economies and further integrate operations, analysts said. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, signed on Sunday by 15 Asia-Pacific economies will progressively reduce tariff rates, eliminate trade barriers and bolster investments among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, and China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Somkiat Tangkitvanich, president of the Thailand Development Research Institute, said the deal is important as it is ""the first and biggest mega-FTA (free-trade agreement) signed"". Somkiat said the trade pact's signatories include two of the world's biggest economies in China and Japan, and Southeast Asia, one of the fastest growing regional economies. ""The signing of RCEP signifies that the region is committed to free trade and rule-based trade regime,"" he said. The RCEP encompasses the supply chain across the East Asian and Southeast Asian regions, home to key manufacturing and exporting countries that can benefit from intraregional tariff reduction programs, Somkiat said. Ruben Carlo Asuncion, chief economist at Union Bank of the Philippines, said the initiative is ""very significant especially at a time of 'deglobalization'"". But the ""historic signing"" of the RCEP has shown that the participating Asia-Pacific economies are committed to open and free trade. ""There is a higher likelihood of trade integration because of the RCEP signing,"" Asuncion said. ""Many studies have delved into the development of strong intraregional trade among ASEAN economies, and having a trade agreement between economies does improve the exchange of goods and services."" The trade pact was first proposed during the 2012 ASEAN Summit in Cambodia and went through more than 30 rounds of negotiations. The eight years of talks were concluded this year, and the agreement was signed at the 37th ASEAN Summit. The final document has over 500 pages and 20 chapters and included provisions on trade remedies, small and medium-sized enterprises, intellectual property, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures. A joint statement signed by the leaders of the 15 countries hailed the trade pact and its expected boost to the region's economy. Timely signing The signing the trade pact is considered timely, given that Asia-Pacific countries are gradually rebuilding their economies while fending off another wave of coronavirus infections. The pandemic, for a time, clamped manufacturing and disrupted trade. But now the RCEP will ""bring back momentum to trade and investments around the world"", said Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. Nicholas Antonio Mapa, a senior economist for Dutch investment bank ING, said tariff cuts and the integration of the supply chain through the RCEP countries will speed up trade and bolster economic activity across the Asia-Pacific region. ""Overall (the RCEP) would be a plus in combating the fallout from COVID-19,"" Mapa said. Park Jin, president of Seoul-based think tank the Asia Future Institute, said the pact will promote economic cooperation between East Asian countries and ASEAN. Countries that signed the RCEP ""can interact with each other through trade investment and economic partnerships"", he said. Ho Meng Kit, CEO of the Singapore Business Federation, said that by enhancing cross-border trade, the trade agreement will help Singaporean companies ""to enjoy greater flexibility in sourcing from a larger pool of suppliers in the region"". Chheang Vannarith, president of the Cambodia-based think tank Asian Vision Institute, said the RCEP can serve as a ""legal and institutional instrument"" that can facilitate the growth of e-commerce. ""What (the private sector) can get is obviously a new opportunity for trade and investment, especially e-commerce and technology, as they can use technology to advance their business interests,"" he said.",ARTICLE,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202011/18/WS5fb480dca31024ad0ba94dde.html,3476527008,China Daily - Global - World,CN,NEWS,NEWS,en_US,http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/world,PRIME SARMIENTO and YANG HAN in Hong Kong,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/Prime Sarmiento and Yang Han in Hong Kong

China&#39;s industrial output rose at a faster-than-expected pace in October, while retail sales continued to recover albeit more slowly than forecast as the world&#39;s second-largest economy emerged from its Covid-19 slump. ""Data releases in China early Monday adds to the positive,"" Terence Wu, strategist at OCBC Bank in Singapore, said in a note. ""Industrial production continued to exceed expectations. Retail sales were softer than expected, but the market chose to take heart from the monthly improvement. ""The posture for USD-CNH remains sideways to lower in the near term.

Fifteen Asia-Pacific economies formed the world&#39;s largest free trade bloc on Sunday, a China-backed deal that excludes the United States. Traders and analysts said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) would improve China&#39;s trade conditions in the region and benefit the yuan. ""The reason why the central bank has a greater tolerance of yuan strength is resilient exports since the outbreak of the pandemic,"" said Liu Ligang, chief China economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong. ""Exports were not affected much by the yuan&#39;s strength. China is ahead of most major economies in resuming work and production, and China manufactures many products that are needed by other countries during lockdowns,"" Liu added.

20279980672,Wed 18-Nov-2020 08:59:51,Landmark RCEP trade pact to boost regional economic integration,"The signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's biggest trade pact, marks a new stride toward regional economic integration among Asia-Pacific countries. After 31 rounds of negotiations over eight years, the trade agreement between 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia and New Zealand was signed on Sunday. Hailed as ""a victory of multilateralism and free trade,"" the pact will vigorously boost confidence in regional trade and investment, reinforce the industrial and supply chains, hasten the economic recovery and promote the long-term prosperity of the region. The RCEP integrates existing free-trade partnerships among participating countries, while establishing new ones between China and Japan, and between Japan and the ROK, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said in a series of articles explaining the trade agreement on its website. The pact optimizes economic and trade rules among signatories, streamlining procedures to facilitate cross-border logistics and introducing negative lists to promote investment liberalization, the MOC said. More economic and technological assistance will be provided for the developing and least-developed economies in the region after the RCEP comes into force, as part of efforts to promote regional coordinated development, according to the ministry. Specifically, RCEP signatories will promote opening-up in trade in goods and services, investment and personnel exchange. After the pact takes effect, more than 90 percent of the import tariffs between participating countries will be phased out, which will reduce production costs and commodity prices, bringing benefits to both enterprises and consumers, said the MOC. The 15 signatories have all pledged wider opening-up in the services-trade sector, focusing on areas including health care, real estate, finance and transportation. Meanwhile, business people will be able to obtain visas more conveniently from RCEP countries, further facilitating trade and investment, said the MOC. Cao Jing, deputy secretary-general of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat, which consists of China, Japan and the ROK, said the signing of the RCEP will lead to robust growth of trade and investment in participating countries as it represents higher-level opening-up, a larger market and better policies. Covering a market of 2.27 billion people and a combined GDP of 26.2 trillion U.S. dollars, the RCEP signatories, which account for about one third of the world's economy, will become a large integrated market, thus injecting impetus into regional and global economic growth, the MOC said. The RCEP will also reduce the current ""obstructions"" in the global industrial chains and supply chains, and accelerate post-pandemic economic recovery, according to Cao. Signed at a time when a coronavirus-triggered recession looms large globally, the RCEP shines rays of hope through the dark clouds of global trade uncertainty, proving to the world that openness and cooperation are a sure path toward common prosperity. The signing of the RCEP is crucial and timely, said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, adding that the RCEP agreement represents a victory for multilateralism over unilateralism and free trade over protectionism. It accommodates the broadest possible interests, conditions and priorities and sends a clear message of East Asian countries working together for shared prosperity, said Ruan.",ARTICLE,http://www.ecns.cn/news/2020-11-18/detail-ihacwpkx9605955.shtml,3364320215,China News - Home,CN,NEWS,NEWS,en_US,http://www.ecns.cn/,Zhang Mingxin,http://www.ecns.cn/Zhang Mingxin
20279066632,Sun 15-Nov-2020 14:07:00,"ASEAN, China, Japan, other partners set world’s biggest trade pact","This image made from a teleconference provided by the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) shows the leaders and trade ministers of 15 Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) countries pose for a virtual group photo in Hanoi on Nov. 15. (VNA via AP) China, Japan and 13 other countries agreed Sunday to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “I am delighted to say that after eight years of hard work, as of today, we have officially brought RCEP negotiations to a conclusion for signing,"" said host country Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. “The conclusion of RCEP negotiation, the largest free trade agreement in the world, will send a strong message that affirms ASEAN’s leading role in supporting the multilateral trading system, creating a new trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalizing the supply chains disrupted by COVID-19 and assisting the post pandemic recovery,” Phuc said. The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office. Apart from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, it includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc. It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements. The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America First"" policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity. Ahead of Sunday's RCEP “special summit"" meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government's support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.” The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalization and multilateral cooperation"" and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report. Now that Trump’s opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve. Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft. Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is “not going to squander that by going back into TPP,"" Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar. But given concerns over China's growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said. The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth. RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world's population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members. India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China. Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports. The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labor and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies. But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society. “RCEP, therefore, is a much-needed platform for the Indo-Pacific’s post-COVID recovery,"" he wrote.

20279518199,Sun 15-Nov-2020 21:43:00,Cambodia signs world’s largest free trade pact,"A visceral hit of merriment captured Cambodia’s trade and investment sector as the leaders of 15 Asia-Pacific nations signed the blockbuster Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade pact on Sunday. Insiders voiced their enthusiasm for the agreement which they say will allow the Kingdom to expand trade and attract more investment from signatory countries. Leaders of the 10 ASEAN states, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea witnessed the signing of the RCEP agreement via video link following the conclusion of the 4th RCEP Summit on the same day. Notably absent from the signing was India, which withdrew from negotiations in November last year. Minister of Economy and Finance Aun Pornmoniroth delegated authority to Minister of Commerce Pan Sorasak to sign the accord. Marking ASEAN’s largest free trade pact, the RCEP has a combined gross domestic product (GDP) to the tune of  26.2 trillion, or 30 per cent of global GDP, and engages 2.2 billion people, according to the ASEAN Secretariat. ASEAN secretary-general Lim Jock Hoi said: “The signing of the RCEP Agreement is a historic event as it underpins ASEAN’s role in leading a multilateral trade agreement of this magnitude, despite global and regional challenges and eight years of negotiations. “RCEP will give a much-needed boost for a swift and robust recovery for businesses and peoples in our region, particularly during the current Covid-19 pandemic crisis.” Singapore’s Minister of Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing told reporters following the signing that the pact will enter into force once six ASEAN countries and three non-ASEAN partners have ratified it, as reported by Bloomberg. Cambodia’s commerce ministry lauded the deal as a historic regional achievement that will reinforce intellectual property and investor protection, promote globalisation, and support the rules-based multilateral trading system anchored in the World Trade Organisation. “It is an indispensable prerequisite for the principles of free and fair trade, and an important driving force for sustainable socio-economic development. “The RCEP agreement will be also an important catalyst in contributing to economic growth, improving the livelihoods of people in the region, and helping to restore regional economic development after the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said. Royal Academy of Cambodia economics researcher Hong Vanak told The Post last month that RCEP is a platform for ASEAN that was years in the making. He said the deal will re-orient the trade and investment landscape in the region, encourage commercial exchanges among members and serve as a vital driving engine for the manufacturing sector. “This means that the countries in the region will enjoy more opportunities to promote exports to other members. At the same time, the RCEP will help to promote trade flow and attract more investments with members to the region,” Vanak said. With RCEP negotiations as a base, the Jakarta-based Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) found that the deal would boost the Kingdom’s GDP an additional two per cent, increase exports by an extra 7.3 per cent and raise investment by an added 23.4 per cent. The ASEAN Secretariat said: “The deal will improve market access with tariffs and quotas eliminated in over 65 per cent of goods traded and make business predictable with common rules of origin and transparent regulations, upon entry into force. “This will encourage firms to invest more in the region, including building supply chains and services, and to generate jobs.” It noted that the agreement comprises 20 chapters, 17 annexes and 54 schedules of commitments that cover market access, rules and disciplines, and economic and technical cooperation.",ARTICLE,http://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/cambodia-signs-worlds-largest-free-trade-pact,3237235817,The Phnom Penh Post,KH,NEWS,NEWS,en_US,http://www.phnompenhpost.com/,May Kunmakara,http://www.phnompenhpost.com/author/may-kunmakara/17732

Joining us live in the studio is Chung Hae-moon, Former South Korean Ambassador to Thailand and former Secretary General of the ASEAN-Korea Centre. Ambassador Chung, thanks for joining us. According to computer simulations recently published by Brookings, RCEP could add 209 billion dollars annually to world incomes, and 500 billion to world trade by 2030. Let's first talk about what it is and the economic significance of this deal. Why did members want this deal particularly now as the entire world battles the Covid pandemic? Is there hope that the pact will help to spur recovery from the Covid pandemic? What are the significance and implications of joining the RCEP for South Korea? There are experts who believe although the deal could increase roughly 200 billion dollars annually to global national income like we discussed by 2030 and also add two-tenths of a percent to the economy of its member states. But, some analysts think the deal is likely to benefit China, Japan and South Korea more than other member states. Why is that so? U.S. policies in Asia need to adjust to the changing realities of East Asia, recognizing the increased role of China, maturing ASEAN integration, and America's diminished relative economic influence. Do you believe the U.S. will join the CPTPP under President-elect Joe Biden? India is one of the countries that's been a part of the progression of RCEP, yet has decided to pass on joining RCEP. Why is that the case, and do they have an open invitation to join at a later time? In terms of regional trade, what does the establishment of RCEP mean for China? Chung Hae-moon, Former South Korean Ambassador to Thailand and former Secretary General of the ASEAN-Korea Centre, many thanks for speaking with us this evening. We appreciate it.",ARTICLE,http://www.arirang.com/News/News_View.asp?nseq=267978,3443555540,The World on Arirang - World,KR,NEWS,NEWS,en_US,http://www.arirang.com/News/News_List.asp?sys_lang=Eng&category=1,arirang.com editor,http://www.arirang.com/arirang.com editor
